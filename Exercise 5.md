## How do you see the files changed within each commit from git log?
To go back and see the changes that have been made within a git file, you can use the command 'git log.' Without any arguments, git log displays a list of all of the commits that have been made within the repository in reverse chronological order - the last created commit is shown first, with each commit displaying its checksum, the author's name and email, the date it was written, and the commit message.

## What does HEAD refer to in the context of git? (Not to be confused with the "HEAD<<<<" one observes within merge conflict)
HEAD refers to the last commit in the current checkout branch - more simply, the current branch the user is on. HEAD can be switched to other commits/branches using the command 'git checkout,' acting as the new starting point for any further changes.
